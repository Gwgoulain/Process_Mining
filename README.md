# Process_Mining
Leveraging the PM4Py library to explore and analyze process mining in the dataset provided in the BPI Challenge 2012.

This repository contains Python code leveraging the PM4Py library to explore and analyze process mining in the dataset provided in the BPI Challenge 2012. The repository includes detailed scripts for:

Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting the event log to ensure compatibility with PM4Py.

Process Discovery: Applying various process mining algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Alpha Miner, and Heuristic Miner) to generate process models such as Petri Nets and BPMN models.

Conformance Checking: Evaluating the alignment between the event log and the discovered models using fitness, precision, simplicity and generalization metrics.

The BPI Challenge 2012 dataset  https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:3926db30-f712-4394-aebc-75976070e91f

represents a real-life event log, offering a rich resource for understanding the behavior of complex processes.
The dataset is provided by a Dutch financial institution and contains detailed information about the application process for personal loans and overdrafts within a global financial company. It includes 262,200 events distributed across 13,087 cases.
